Project Title: Optimizing Nurse Time Allocation in a Hospital Setting

Project Description:

This study examined how nurses allocate their time in a busy hospital environment, aiming to identify areas where workflow and technology could be improved to enhance patient care.

Key Objectives:

Quantify the time nurses spend on direct patient care versus administrative tasks and documentation.
Identify potential opportunities to streamline workflows and improve efficiency.
Contribute data-driven insights for better staffing and resource allocation decisions.
Methodology:

Data Collection (8 months): Data was gathered from multiple hospital units across two locations using Hill-ROM and Imprivata systems, along with weekly activity spreadsheets.
Data Cleaning: Extensive cleaning was performed to eliminate errors and accurately categorize activities into:
Patient Care
Documentation Time
Not in Study Time (breaks, communication, etc.)
Data Analysis: The cleaned data was analyzed to determine the proportions of time spent on each activity type, with comparisons across units.


Key Findings:

Nurses spent a significant portion of their time (53.4%) on documentation and administrative tasks.
Direct patient care accounted for 34.3% of nurses' time.
There was variability in time allocation across units, with women's health having the highest proportion of direct patient care.
Opportunities for Improvement:

Further exploration of "Not in Study Time" to identify specific non-patient care activities (breaks, communication, etc.).
Analysis of overtime hours to assess potential nurse burnout.
Correlation of Workstation data with activity logs to pinpoint automatable tasks.
Development of strategies to reduce interruptions and task-switching.
Potential Impact:

This research provides valuable insights to healthcare administrators for improving nurse efficiency and satisfaction, ultimately leading to better patient care.
